/**
 * @file ObstaclesPerceptor.h
 *
 * This file declares a module that detects obstacles in the color-segmented image.
 * This is a more compact rewrite of the RobotsPerceptor by Michel Bartsch.
 * Points below obstacles are found by vertically scanning down from the field boundary.
 * Such a candidate point is the lowest edge between non-field color and field color
 * where enough non-field color came above it. These candidates are processed from
 * bottom to top, merging neighboring candidates on a similar height.
