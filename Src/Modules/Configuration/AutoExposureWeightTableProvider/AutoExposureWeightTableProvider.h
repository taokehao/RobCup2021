/**
 * @file AutoExposureWeightTableProvider.h
 *
 * This file declares a module that detemines how different areas of a camera image should be
 * weighted when computing the auto exposure. The auto exposure weight table consists of 5x5
 * weights for corresponding image areas. The module limits the area considered to a
 * definable distance from the robots. In addition, the robot's body is excluded. If the ball
 * is expected to be in the image, it will influence the exposure computation with a
 * configurable ratio.
