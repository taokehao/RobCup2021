 * Important remarks about units:
 *
 * For each parameter, the respective comments describe its unit.
 * The following units are used:
 *  - Distances:  Millimeters (mm)
 *  - Angles:     Radian
 *  - Time:       Milliseconds (ms)
 *  - Speed:      Millimeters per second (mm/s)
 *  - Timestamp:  Milliseconds since system / software start (ms)
 */

/*
 * Important remarks about streaming sizes:
 * NOT all values are streamed as a whole!
 * If a unit is not streamed in its natural range, a commentary will indicate
 * the range as it is interpreted.
 * The general comment pattern is "[rangeFrom..rangeTo (in precision)]".
 *
 * E.g.
 *  uint32_t value0;    //-- no comment     (This will be streamed as full 4 Byte)
 *  bool     value1;    //-- no comment     (This may be streamed as 1 Bit)
 *  uint32_t value2;    // < [3..12]        (This will be streamed with minumum value
 *                                                                and maximum value 12)
 *  uint16_t value3;    // < [3..12] bla    (Same as above)
 *  uint32_t value2;    // < [4..10 (2)]    (This will be streamed with a precision of 2, a minumum
 *                                            value of 4 and a maximum value of 10.
 *                                            This means after streaming it can hold 2,4,6,8 and 10)
 *  uint32_t time1      // < [delta 0..-10] (This will be streamed in relation to the timestamp of
 *                                            the message in range of 0 to -10.)
